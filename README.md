# No Arrows Mod [ORIGINAL!]

Basically no arrows are moved or rotated, only are squares to be almost not possible to know what arrow is where.
You should learn where are arrows before playing.

# Arrows
[LEFT]	[DOWN]	[UP]	[RIGHT]
Remember their pattern.

# Not Very Interesting
Hope you'll enjoy most of this mod.
NO ARROWS ARE MOVED, ROTATED OR NEW SONGS ADDED!
JUST ARROWS DELETION TO SQUARES!
When you hit right arrow [square] it shows lighten arrow on the place.
